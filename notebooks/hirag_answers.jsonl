{"query": "What is the responsibility of the BswM in relation to the EcuM during the UP phase?", "answer": "During the UP phase, the **BSW Mode Manager (BswM)** is responsible for executing actions and managing mode-dependent scheduling as part of the integration process. Specifically, the BswM handles mode arbitration, triggers the initialization of BSW modules (e.g., NvM, Com, DEM, FIM), and indirectly starts the RTE and SW-Cs through its action lists. The BswM also receives notifications from the NvM when `NvM_ReadAll` is completed and ensures that subsequent initialization steps are executed in the correct order. This process continues until the ECU reaches full operational capacity. \n\n(Referenced from **UP Phase**, *Specification of ECU State Manager*, AUTOSAR CP R20-11)", "context_snippets": [{"idx": 270, "score": 0.6450545787811279, "id": "e609dbbd-31bd-484f-8b6f-7cc0e3806428", "title": "UP Phase", "level": 3, "parent_id": "58a08595-46ea-41d9-9baa-f003d9f445f3", "content": "Essentially, the UP phase starts when the BSW Scheduler has started andBswM_-\nInit has been called.

The BSW\nMode Manager Module then starts mode arbitration and all further BSW initialization,\nstarting the RTE and (implicitly) starting SW-Cs becomes code executed in the BswM’s\naction lists or driven by mode-dependent scheduling, effectively under the control of\nthe integrator.\nInitializing the NvM and calling NvM_Readall therefore also becomes integration code.\nThis means that the integrator is responsible for triggering the initialization of Com,\nDEM and FIM at the end of NvM_ReadAll. The NvM will notify the BswM when NvM_\nReadAll has finished.\nNote that the RTE can be started after NvM and COM have been initialized. Note also\nthat the communication stack need not be fully initialized before COM can be initialized.\nThese changes initialize BSW modules as well as starting SW-Cs in arbitrary order\nuntil the ECU reaches full capacity and the changes continue to determine the ECU\ncapabilities thereafter as well.\nUltimately mode switches stop SW-Cs and de-initialize the BSW so that the Up phase\nends when the ECU reaches a state where it can be powered off.\nSo, as far as the ECU Manager module is concerned, the BSW and SW-Cs run until\nthey are ready for the ECU to be shut down or put to sleep.\nRefer to the Guide to Mode Management [4] for guidance on how to design mode-\ndriven ECU management and for configuring the BSW Mode Manager accordingly.\n31 of 210 Document ID 78: AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager\n\nSpecification of ECU State Manager\nAUTOSAR CP R20-11"}, {"idx": 295, "score": 0.5596125721931458, "id": "20e36899-07f7-41fe-b733-03b3eefeeee2", "title": "UP Phase", "level": 2, "parent_id": "538f9c02-2f12-4550-b6cd-b044ff47c170", "content": "In the UP Phase, theEcuM_MainFunction is executed regularly and it has three\nmajor functions:\n•To check if wakeup sources have woken up and to initiate wakeup validation, if\nnecessary (see 7.6.4 Activities in the WakeupValidation Sequence)\n•To update the Alarm Clock timer\n•Arbitrate RUN and POST_RUN requests and releases."}, {"idx": 420, "score": 0.5243956446647644, "id": "7bdceee3-2f2d-4fb3-b3ae-84cbec9083c8", "title": "Callouts from the UP Phase", "level": 3, "parent_id": "81cff668-df76-4dd9-979f-90a95350f67b", "content": ""}, {"idx": 71, "score": 0.5176847577095032, "id": "df743753-cd53-4641-8ac4-0896f0ea377d", "title": "EcuM Clock Time in the UP Phase . . . . . . . . . . 68", "level": 4, "parent_id": "9603843a-1576-4502-843b-864e623ac44d", "content": ""}]}

{"query": "Explain the wakeup handling process as shown in Figure 9.12 (FlexRay transceiver wakeup by polling).", "answer": "The wakeup handling process for the FlexRay transceiver by polling, as shown in **Figure 9.12**, involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Regular Polling**: The ECU State Manager module periodically checks the FlexRay Interface module (`FrIf`), which in turn queries the FlexRay Transceiver Driver module (`FrTrcv`) for wakeup events.\n\n2. **Wakeup Detection**: If the transceiver detects a wakeup event, the `FrTrcv_CheckWakeupByTransceiver()` function is called to confirm the wakeup.\n\n3. **Wakeup Event Notification**: Upon detecting a wakeup, the transceiver driver informs the ECU State Manager by invoking `EcuM_SetWakeupEvent()` with the corresponding wakeup source identifier.\n\n4. **Interrupt Handling**: The process may involve enabling or disabling interrupts (`EnableAllInterrupts()` and `DisableAllInterrupts()`) to manage system states during wakeup handling.\n\n5. **Resource Management**: Functions like `GetResource()` and `ReleaseResource()` are used to manage shared resources during the wakeup process.\n\nThis polling-based approach ensures that the system can detect wakeup events without relying on interrupts, making it suitable for scenarios where interrupt-based wakeup is not feasible. \n\n(Referenced from **Figure 9.12: FlexRay transceiver wake up by polling**, Document ID 78: AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager).", "context_snippets": [{"idx": 478, "score": 0.7457555532455444, "id": "d139971f-5abe-4fa7-9689-878a503991da", "title": "173 of 210 Document ID 78: AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager", "level": 3, "parent_id": "93c89afc-b59b-42a0-86c4-1adb4b614ea3", "content": "Specification of ECU State Manager\nAUTOSAR CP R20-11\n\u0001 \u0002 \u0004 \u0005 \u0006 \u0007 \b \u0005 \u0006 \t \n \u000b \u0006 \f \n \u000e \u000b \u000b \u000f \u0010 \u0004 \u0011 \u0006 \u0012 \b \u0013 \n \u000e \f \u0006 \t \u0012 \u0014 \f \u0006 \u0014 \u0010 \n \f \b \u0006 \u000e \u0004 \u000e \u0014 \u000f \u0010 \u0004 \u0012 \u0014 \u0014 \n \f \u0006 \t \u0004 \u0005 \u0012 \u0004 \u0004 \u0005 \u0006 \u0015 \f \u0010 \u0016 \f \u0012 \u0017 \u0002 \u000b \u0010 \n \b \u0010 \u000f \u0004 \u000e \u000f \n \u0006 \u0014 \u0012 \u0002 \u0004 \u0006 \f\n\u0018 \u0019 \u001a \u001b \u000e \u000f \u0014 \u0004 \f \n \b \u0004 \u000e \u0010 \u000f \u0011 \u0006 \b \u0012 \n \u0014 \u0006 \f \u0006 \u001c \u0014 \b \u0005 \u0006 \t \n \u000b \u000e \u000f \u0016 \u0004 \u0012 \u001d \u0006 \u0014 \u0015 \u000b \u0012 \b \u0006 \u0012 \u0002 \u0004 \u0006 \f \u0010 \b \b \n \f \f \u0006 \u000f \b \u0006 \u0010 \u0002 \u0012 \u000f \u0001 \u0007 \u001e \u001f \u0012 \u0004  !\n«Peripheral»\nFlexRay Transceiver\nHardware\n«module»\nOs\n«module»\nEcuM\nIntegration\nCode\n«module»\nMcu\n«module»\nIcu\n«module»\nFrIf\n«module»\nFr\n«module»\nFrTrcv\n«Peripheral»\nFlexRay\nController\nHALT\nGOSLEEP\nSLEEP\nWAKEUP I\nopt Wakeup detected\n\" # \u0006 \b \n \u0004 \u000e \u0010 \u000f \b \u0010 \u000f \u0004 \u000e \u000f \n \u0006 \u0014 \u0012 \u0002 \u0004 \u0006 \f \u0018 \u0019 \u001a \u001b \u000e \u000f \u0014 \u0004 \f \n \b \u0004 \u000e \u0010 \u000f !\n\u001b \u0005 \u000e \u0014 \b \u0012 \u000b \u000b \u0005 \u0012 \u0014 \u0004 \u0010 \u0011 \u0006 \f \u0006 \u0015 \u0006 \u0012 \u0004 \u0006 \t \u0002 \u0010 \f \u0011 \u0010 \u0004 \u0005 $ \u000b \u0006 # \u001e \u0012 % \b \u0005 \u0012 \u000f \u000f \u0006 \u000b \u0014 \u0010 \u000f\n\u0004 \u0005 \u0006 \u0014 \u0012 \u0017 \u0006 \u000f \u0006 \u0004 \n \u0010 \f \u001d\n&\n\u000e !

Wake up source identifiers should be shared\nbetween transceiver and controller as the ECU State Manager module only needs to\nknow the network that has woken up and passes that on to the Communication Man-\nager module.\nIn interrupt case or in shared interrupt case it is not clear which specific wake up\nsource (CAN controller, CAN transceiver, LIN controller etc.) detected the wake\nup. Therefore the integrator has to assign the derived wakeupSource of EcuM_\nCheckWakeup(wakeupSource), which could stand for a shared interrupt or just for\nan interrupt channel, to specific wake up sources which are passed to CanIf_Check\nWakeup(WakeupSource). So here the parameters wakeupSource from EcuM_Check\nWakeup() could be different to WakeupSource of CanIf_CheckWakeup or they could\nequal. It depends on the hardware topology and the implementation in the integrator\ncode of EcuM_CheckWakeup().\nDuring CanIf_CheckWakeup(WakeupSource) the CAN Interface module (CanIf) will\ncheck if any device (CAN communication controller or transceiver) is configured with\nthe value of \"WakeupSource\". If this is the case, the device is checked for wake up via\nthe corresponding device driver module. If the device detected a wake up, the device\ndriver informs EcuM via EcuM_SetWakeupEvent(sources). The parameter \"sources\"\nis set to the configured value at the device. Thus it is set to the value CanIf_Check\nWakeup() was called with.\nMultiple devices might be configured with the same wake up source value. But if de-\nvices are connected to different bus medium and they are wake-able, it makes sense\nto configure them with different wake up sources.\nThe following CAN Wake-up Sequences are partly optional, because there is no spec-\nification for the \"Integration Code\". Thus it is implementation specific if e.g. during Ecu\nM_CheckWakeup() the CanIf is called to check the wake up source.\n162 of 210 Document ID 78: AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager\n\nSpecification of ECU State Manager\nAUTOSAR CP R20-11\n«Peripheral»\nCAN Transceiver\nHardware\n«Peripheral»\nCanController\n«module»\nCanTrcv\n«module»\nCan\n«module»\nCanIf\n«module»\nIcu\n«module»\nMcu\nIntegration\nCode\n«module»\nEcuM\n«module»\nOs\n\u0001 \u0002 \u0003 \u0002 \u0004 \u0005 \u0002 \u0007 \b \t \u0002 \n \u000b \u0003 \u0002 \f \f \u0002 \u0005 \n \u000b \f \b \u0002 \u000e \n \u0004 \u0003 \u0003 \n \u000f \n \u000e \t \u0002 \f \u000e \u0004 \u0005 \u0010 \u0005 \u000e \n \f \u000b \u0011 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0014\n\u000e \t \u0002 \u0007 \b \t \u0002 \n \u000b \u0003 \u0002 \f \u000f\n\u0015\n\u0003 \u0003 \u0011 \n \u000e\n\u0016\n\u0002 \u0004 \b\n\u0017\n\u000b\n\u0015\n\f \u0002 \n \u0004 \u0005 \f \u0002 \u0005 \n \u000b \f \b \u0002\n\u0015\n\u000e\n\u0015\n\u0005 \u0011 \n \u000e \u0004 \u0005 \u0005 \u000b \f \u0002 \n \u000e \t \u0004 \u000e \u000e \t \u0002\n\u0018\n\f \n\n\u0019\n\f \u0004\n\u001a \u0014\n\u0003 \n \u000f \b \n \u0011 \u000e\n\u0015\n\u0011 \u000b \u0002 \u0005 \u0004\n\u0014\n\u000e \u0002 \f\n\u001b \u001c \u001d \u001e \u0015\n\u0011 \u0005 \u000e \f \u000b \b \u000e\n\u0015\n\n \u0011\n\u0016\n\u0002 \b \u0004 \u000b \u0005 \u0002 \f \u0002\n\u001f\n\u0005 \b \t \u0002 \n \u000b \u0003\n\u0015\n\u0011\n\u0019\n\u000e \u0004 \u0010 \u0002 \u0005\n\u0018\n\u0003 \u0004 \b \u0002 \u0004\n\u0014\n\u000e \u0002 \f \n \b \b \u000b \f \f \u0002 \u0011 \b \u0002 \n\n\u0014\n\u0004 \u0011\n\u0013\n\u0007 \u0001\n \n\u0004 \u000e\n!\n\u0012\nHALT\n\" #\n\u0002 \b \u000b \u000e\n\u0015\n\n \u0011 \b \n \u0011 \u000e\n\u0015\n\u0011 \u000b \u0002 \u0005 \u0004\n\u0014\n\u000e \u0002 \f\n\u001b \u001c \u001d \u001e \u0015\n\u0011 \u0005 \u000e \f \u000b \b \u000e\n\u0015\n\n \u0011 \u0012\n \n\u0004 \u0011 \u0007\n$\n\u000f\n\u0015\n\u0003 \u0003 \t \u0004\n%\n\u0002 \b \u0004 \u0003 \u0003 \u0002 \n \n\u0004 \u0011\n\u0013 \u0014 &\n\u0007 \u0002 \u000e\n \n\n \u0011 \u000e \f \n \u0003 \u0003 \u0002 \f\n$\n\n \n \u0002 \u0004 \u0011 \n \n\u0004 \u0011\n\u0013 \u0014 &\n\u0007 \u0002 \u000e\n\u001e\n\f \u0004 \u0011 \u0005 \b \u0002\n\u0015 %\n\u0002 \f\n$\n\n \n \u0002 \u000f \t \u0002 \u0011\n\u0019\n\n\n\u0015\n\u0011\n\u0019\n\u000e \n \u0005 \u0003 \u0002 \u0002\n\u0018\n\u0012\nGOSLEEP\nSLEEP\nWAKEUP I\nWAKEUP \nVALIDATION\nEcuM_DisableWakeupSources(EcuM_WakeupSourceType)\nEcuM_SetWakeupEvent(EcuM_WakeupSourceType)\nCanIf_SetTrcvWakeupMode(uint8,\nCanTrcv_TrcvWakeupModeType)\nEcuM_CheckWakeup(EcuM_WakeupSourceType)\nCanTrcv_SetWakeupMode(uint8,\nCanTrcv_TrcvWakeupModeType)\nWakeup\ninterrupt()\nCanTrcv_SetWakeupMode(uint8,\nCanTrcv_TrcvWakeupModeType)\nMcu_SetMode()\nactivate\nPLL()\nGetResource(uint8)\nCanIf_CheckWakeup(EcuM_WakeupSourceType):\nStd_ReturnType\nReturn from\ninterrupt()\nEnableAllInterrupts()\nCanTrcv_CheckWakeup(uint8):\nStd_ReturnType\nEcuM_EnableWakeupSources(EcuM_WakeupSourceType)\nMcu_SetMode\n(Mcu_ModeType)\nReleaseResource(uint8)\nEnableAllInterrupts()\nCanIf_SetTrcvWakeupMode(uint8,\nCanTrcv_TrcvWakeupModeType)\nMcu_SetMode\n(Mcu_ModeType)\nDisableAllInterrupts()\nIcu_DisableWakeup(Icu_ChannelType)\nDisableAllInterrupts()\nIcu_EnableWakeup(Icu_ChannelType)\nFigure 9.4: CAN transceiver wake up by interrupt\n163 of 210 Document ID 78: AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager\n\nSpecification of ECU State Manager\nAUTOSAR CP R20-11\nFigure 9.4 shows the CAN transceiver wakeup via interrupt.

It depends on the used\nCAN transceivers and controllers, which function calls in Integrator Code EcuM_Start\nWakeupSource are necessary. In Figure 9.7 e.g. the needed function calls to start and\nstop the wake up sources from CAN state manager module are mentioned.\nNote that, although controller and transceiver are switched on, no CAN message will\nbe forwarded by the CAN interface module (CanIf) to any upper layer module.\nOnly when the corresponding PDU channel modes of the CanIf are set to \"Online\", it\nwill forward CAN messages.\nThe CanIf recognizes the successful reception of at least one message and\nrecords it as a successful validation. During validation the ECU State Manager\nmodule regularly checks the CanIf in Integrator Code EcuM_CheckValidation (see\n[SWS_EcuM_02925]).\nThe ECU State Manager module will, after successful validation, continue the normal\nstartup of the CAN network via the Communication Manager module.\nOtherwise, it will shutdown the CAN controller and transceiver in EcuM_StopWakeup\nSources (see [SWS_EcuM_02926]) and go back to sleep.\nThe resulting sequence is shown in Figure 9.7 .\n167 of 210 Document ID 78: AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager\n\nSpecification of ECU State Manager\nAUTOSAR CP R20-11\n«module»\nEcuM\n\u0001 \u0002 \u0004 \u0005 \u0006 \u0007 \b \t \t \n \u0007 \u0007 \u000b \b \f \n \u000e \f \u000f \u0010 \u000e \u0011 \u000f \u0012 \u0002 \u000f \u0007 \u000f \u0002 \u0010 \u000f \t \u000e \u0011 \n \u0010 \u0013 \u0014\n\u000e \t \u0012\n\u0015 \u0015\n\n \t \u0011 \f \u0014\n\u0015\n\n \t \n \u000f \n \n \u0010\n\u0016\n\n \u0007 \u0007 \u000e\n\u0017\n\n\u0018\nIntegration Code «module»\nMcu\n«module»\nIcu\n«module»\nCanIf\n«module»\nCanSM\nWAKEUP \nVALIDATION\nGOSLEEP\nloop Validate Wakeup Event\nalt Check Validation Result\n[SUCCESSFUL VALIDATION]\n[NO VALIDATION YET]\n[VALIDATION TIMEOUT]\nEcuM_StartWakeupSources(EcuM_WakeupSourceType)\nEcuM_ValidateWakeupEvent(EcuM_WakeupSourceType)\nStart validation\ntimeout()\nStop validation\ntimeout()\nEcuM_StopWakeupSources(EcuM_WakeupSourceType)\nCanIf_CheckValidation(EcuM_WakeupSourceType)\nCanSM_StopWakeupSource(Std_ReturnType,\nNetworkHandleType)\nEcuM_CheckValidation(EcuM_WakeupSourceType)\nDetect validation\ntimeout()\nCanSM_StartWakeupSource(Std_ReturnType,\nNetworkHandleType)\nFigure 9.7: CAN wake up validation\n168 of 210 Document ID 78: AUTOSAR_SWS_ECUStateManager\n\nSpecification of ECU State Manager\nAUTOSAR CP R20-11"}]}
